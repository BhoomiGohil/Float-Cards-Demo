# CSS Float Example

This project features a simple responsive webpage created using CSS Float and media queries, inspired by Jen Kramerâ€™s course on Front End Master. This webpage illustrates the use of the float method in CSS layout, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses compared to Flexbox.

## Features

- Responsive design utilizing media queries
- Demonstration of the CSS Float layout method
- Updated card radius and padding to enhance the design based on Jen Kramer's original example

## Visual Design

Below are visual representations of both Jen Kramer's example and my implementation:
