# CSS Float Example

This project features a simple responsive webpage created using CSS Float and media queries, inspired by Jen Kramer’s course on Front End Master. This webpage illustrates the use of the float method in CSS layout, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses compared to Flexbox.

## Features

- Responsive design utilizing media queries
- Demonstration of the CSS Float layout method
- Updated card radius and padding to enhance the design based on Jen Kramer's original example

## Visual Design
